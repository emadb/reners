# Reners

A super simple utility to massively rename your files

### Usage

```
$ reners <starting_folder> <string_to_search> <string_to_replace>
```

For example:

```
$ reners ./foo bar baz
```

Renames all the files inside the `foo` folder (and recursively in all its subfolders) the files that contains `bar` with `baz` (it replace `bar` with `baz`).
